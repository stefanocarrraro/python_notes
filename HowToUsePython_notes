# To print a char just use:   
name = 'Aldo'
print('bla bla')
print(name)

# To print a variable use:
x = 10
print(x)

# Boolean variable (use capital letter)
check = False
check = True

# Getting an Input:
number = input('insert number ') #NOTE: EVEN IF YOU ENTER A NUMBER, THE INPUT COMMAND STORE IT AS A STRING!!!!
# Hence,
number = int(number)    # for integer
number = float(number)  # for a decimal number
number = bool(number)   # for a boolean variable
number = str(number)    # for a string

# Compbining things to plot
print('Age = ' + number)

# NOTE: for mathematical operators, there is

print(10 / 3)   # prints the decimal number
print(10 // 6)  # prints the lower closest integer
print(10 % 4)   # prints the remainder (il resto) of a division
print(10 ** 3)  # prints the exponent 10^3
print(10 ^3)    # is NOT the exponent!! it's the XOR logic


# USEFUL FOR PROGRAMMING
# In python to do 
i = 0
i = i + 1
# you can do 
i += 1      # and it's possible tu use also [ i -= 1 ] or [ i *= 5 ]

# comparison operators: == , != , < , > , <= , >=

# Logical expressio: it's possible to use both 
# and = &
# or = |
# not = !

# NOTE: when usinf if cycles : is needed after the condition

if i < 4:
    print('idk')
elif i < 10:
    print('IK')

print('done')
# NOTE: to end the if cycle press SHIFT + TAB and when the line is no indented anymore the cycle is finished (there's no end)

# same thing with while and for

while i < 10:
    print('while')
    i = 10

for item in range(2, 10, 2):   # range from 2 to 10 (EXCLUDED) with a pass of 2
    print(item)

# the range(4) function returns a vector from 0 to 3 (4 numbers)
# although if we print range(0,4) it shows: range(0,4) and not [0 1 2 3]


# Using arrays:
nu = [10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 11]
print(nu)
nu.insert(4, 6) # inserts number 6 in position 4
print(nu)
nu.append(1)    # inserts 1 at the end of the array
print(nu)
nu.remove(11)   # it removes 11 from the array, whichever positions it has
print(nu)
print(nu[0])    # this prints the first number NOTE: IN PYTHON THE INDEX COUNTING STARTS FROM 0
print(nu[-1])   # this prints the las number
print(nu[0:5])  # prints all the number up to the 5th excluded, so 10 9 8 7 6
print(11 in nu) # checks if the array has the number 11
print(len(nu))  # prints the lenght of nu
nu.clear()

# NOTE: if you define vectors like
n = (1,2,3,4)
# you define a tuple, which cannot be changed
